# Stormworks Vehicle Price Inspector
This is a simple tool to help you visualize which components add up to the total price of a vehicle in Stormworks. Hopefully some may find it useful for their career playthroughs in case your wallet's looking a bit thin and you may have to strip some components.

# Features
• Pie chart displaying top 10 most expensive components  
• Table showing all components and their amount, individual price and total price  
• Prices are dynamically parsed from Stormworks definitions  

# Future Features *(maybe)*
• Ability to remove components using the table  
• Less crappy UI design
